#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering.

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 ANS:  Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software apllications
       Ensures scalabele maintainable a highquality software is created

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 
     ANS: Birth of software engineering 
          Birth of software developmwnt life cycle
          Development software dvelopment Methodologies  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    ANS: Planning : this is the choosing and alocation of resources
         Desighn : creation of both the high level and low lwvel design of the software
         Development : this is coding of the modules involved 
         Testing : this is the phase where the prodictis tested and debuged
         Deployment : in this phase the software is deloyed to the users 
         Mentainace : this the phase where the software maintained though diffrent version deployment and updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
       Waterfall: A linear approach where each phase is completed before moving on to the next. 
                  Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements (e.g., systems).
       Agile: An iterative and flexible approach focused on collaboration and incremental delivery.
              Ideal for dynamic projects (e.g., mobile applocation development projects ).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
     Software Developer: Writes code, implements features, and troubleshoots.
     Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures the software is bug-free, conducts tests, and verifies functionality sa well as code authenticity.
     Project Manager: Manages timelines, resources, and ensures  goals are met.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process.Give examples of each.
       IDEs: Tools like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ help developers write and debug code efficiently by providing features like auto-completion.
        VCS: Systems like Git track code changes, allow collaboration, and help manage version history, making it easier to work in teams and revert mistakes.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Problem: Meeting dedlines and communication challanges
   Solution: USing agile methods to mitigate this issuses
     
     

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
          Unit Testing: Tests individual components for correctness.
   Integration Testing: Tests interactions between different modules.
        System Testing: Verifies the complete system works as expected.
    Acceptance Testing: Ensures the software meets user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. 
This is the practice of engineering inputs or questions in a way that makes AI models isuues relevant and useful otputs 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 ANS: Tell me about birds 
      Provive a brief overvew of diffrent common bird species
